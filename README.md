## Context
**CAV AutoInsurance**, a well-established auto insurance provider since 2000, operates in a highly competitive market. To sustain growth and improve its market position, the company aims to enhance its marketing strategies and customer retention efforts. Specifically, **CAV AutoInsurance** seeks to develop a more targeted approach to customer retention and optimize its marketing campaigns. By understanding the value of each customer, the company intends to allocate resources more effectively, maximize the impact of its campaigns, and ultimately drive better customer engagement and increased profitability.

## Business Problem Statement
In 2011, CAV AutoInsurance was confronted with a substantial obstacle, with only 14.6% of their insured customers electing to renew their policies following a retention campaign. This low renewal rate revealed that 85.4% of their customers were not engaged, indicating that their current strategy of treating all customers the same was both ineffective and resource-intensive. The broad, one-size-fits-all approach failed to address the diverse needs of their customer base, emphasising the necessity for a more targeted and efficient strategy to enhance customer retention and optimise marketing efforts.

1. The marketing team launched a new campaign, categorizing efforts based on the Months Since Policy Inception, dividing them into three equal segments. This campaign was structured into three tiers, each with different costs:
- Marketing Campaign Low: 539 customers (0-34 months) at $25 each.
- Marketing Campaign Medium: 513 customers (35-63 months) at $50 each.
- Marketing Campaign High: 509 customers (64-99 months) at $150 each.

2. CAV AutoInsurance is experiencing significant challenges in analyzing Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and improving customer retention. The company currently faces an 85.4% customer churn rate, and recent marketing efforts, segmented by the number of month since policy inception <sup>[1](https://www.upwork.com/hire/data-analysts/cost/)</sup>, have not produced the expected results, leading to inefficient use of resources and low customer engagement. The current manual process for CLV analysis, which costs $20 per customer and takes approximately per hours, is both costly and time-consuming, limiting the company‚Äôs ability to scale its operations effectively.

The company recognised the need for a more advanced solution and engaged a data science team to develop a new strategy based on customer data. This strategy aims to predict and understand the value of each customer, creating a more targeted approach that will engage customers more effectively and improve retention by focusing on their specific needs.

Key Points:

1. What steps can we take to optimise our sales strategy in order to retain our customers?
2. How can machine learning models be developed to accurately predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)? This will enable us to understand customer value and make decisions regarding management strategies.
3. How can we develop a clustering model to effectively segment customers? This will help us to manage risk and improve customer engagement and retention.
4. How can we accurately predict customer behaviour and optimise marketing strategies across diverse customer segments? This will help us to maximise revenue and retention. We must identify the most impactful characteristic influencing customer decisions.
